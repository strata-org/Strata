Based on Cedar's Term language.
(https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-spec/blob/main/cedar-lean/Cedar/SymCC/Solver.lean)
This file defines a simple interface to an SMT solver running in a separate
process. Callers communicate with the solver by issuing commands with
s-expressions encoded as strings. The interface is based on
[lean-smt](https://github.com/ufmg-smite/lean-smt/).

 A Solver is an interpreter for SMTLib scripts, which are passed to the solver
 via its `smtLibInput` stream. Solvers optionally have an `smtLibOutput` stream
 to which they print the results of executing the commands received on the input
 stream. We assume that both the input and output streams conform to the SMTLib
 standard: the inputs are SMTLib script commands encoded as s-expressions, and
 the outputs are the s-expressions whose shape is determined by the standard for
 each command. We don't have an error stream here, since we configure solvers to
 run in quiet mode and not print anything to the error stream.

  Returns a Solver for the given path and arguments. This function expects
  `path` to point to an SMT solver executable, and `args` to specify valid
  arguments to that solver.

  Returns an instance of the solver that is backed by the executable
  specified in the environment variable "SOLVER".

/--
  Returns a solver that writes all issued commands to the given file handle `h`.
  Commands that produce output, such as `checkSat`, write the command to `h` and
  return values that are sound according to the SMTLIb spec (but generally not
  useful). For example, `Solver.checkSat` returns `Decision.unknown`. This
  function expects `h` to be write-enabled.

  Returns a solver that writes all issued commands to the given buffer `b`.
  Commands that produce output, such as `checkSat`, write the command to `b` and
  return values that are sound according to the SMTLIb spec (but generally not
  useful). For example, `Solver.checkSat` returns `Decision.unknown`.

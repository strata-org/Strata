Add support for function declarations within statement blocks

This PR adds the ability to declare functions as a statement `Stmt.funDecl  in Strata Core, enabling local declarations and non-recursive function definitions that can be used within procedures.

## Changes
- Implemented statement-level operations (variable analysis, substitution, type erasure) for funcDecl
- Added type checking that converts between PureFunc and Function representations, handling type monomorphization
- Implemented evaluation that makes function context updatable locally by adding declared functions to the factory
- Extended all program transformations to handle funcDecl (pass-through for most, sorry for correctness proofs)
- Added `ToFormat` instances to properly display function bodies in verification output

## Testing
Added tests in StatementEvalTests demonstrating funcDecl functionality: declaring helper functions within statement blocks and using them in subsequent statements, including symbolic variable capture from enclosing scope.

## Notes
- CallElimCorrect proof uses `sorry` for funcDecl cases - will be addressed when old variables are removed

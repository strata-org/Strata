# DDM User Manual

Strata dialects are defined in their own domain-specific language that
can be embededed in Lean or used externally.

This Verso package provides HTML documentation of the Strata dialect
definition language.  The documentation can be generated by the command

```
lake exe docs
```

The output will be written to `_out/single-page`.  Links in Verso
documentation do not work if the file is opened in the browser directly.
Instead, we recommend launching a local web server to view the
documentation.
If Python is available, then this can be done with the command

```
python -m http.server 1080 -d _out/html-single
```

This will print out a URL that can be opened in a browser to view the documentation.
